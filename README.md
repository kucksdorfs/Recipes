Kucksdorfs Recipes
=======
This project is based on [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org)

[![CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/img/cake-logo.png)](http://www.cakephp.org)

Kucksdorfs Recipes was built as a side project in my own spare time. The latest version will always be host on [my website](http://www.kucksdorfs.com).
This project was started because I hosted all my recipes in a privately shared (shared with select individuals) on my google drive. These varied from PDF Printouts from various websites, to scans from printed documents.
This was created to take all those "things" in my drive and make them available to a private website hosted on my LAN. I am opening this project up to the public under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).

This product is only meant to be a repository for recipes. New functionality will always be considered, but not always implemented.

Lastly, I am not liable for any copyright infringment with this project. If this site is hosted by myself or anyone else on the public internet, then the website administrator takes responsibility for any and all recipes uploaded to the website (unless otherwise noted under the licensing agreement).
